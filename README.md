# SafeWalk for iOS - CS121
An app that allows the user to enter a start and end location, and the safest routes are shown for you with past crime markers along the way. (all data is verified and originates from the FBI databases)

To get this app running, simply open the project on XCode!

[Here is some GitHub branching + pulling
